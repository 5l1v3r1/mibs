            deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the

            resulting in immediate termination of the

            segment may be sent from the managed node to the

          media-specific MIB for that interface.  After invoking
          a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to
          determine the outcome.  If an agent can not perform
          the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
          object ifTestCode can be used to provide further
          test-specific or interface-specific (or even
          enterprise-specific) information concerning the
          outcome of the test.  Only one test can be in progress
          on each interface at any one time.  If one test is in
          progress when another test is invoked, the second test
          is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when a
          prior test is active on another interface.
          Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
          obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for
          the interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with

                     agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

                retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

                if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

          A manager station first retrieves the value of the

          periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary,
          until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The

          object to the value it just retrieved, the same
          ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding
          ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself.  If
          the set operation succeeds then the manager has
          obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of
          the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per
          the semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set
          operation indicates that some other manager has
          obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry.
 
          Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
          setup, and then the test is initiated by setting
          ifTestType.  On completion of the test, the agent sets
          ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the
          manager can retrieve the results.  In the (rare) event
          that the invocation of tests by two network managers
          were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that
          the first test's results might be overwritten by the
          second test's results prior to the first results being
          read.  This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a
          network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as
          retrieving the test results, and ensuring that the
          results are for the desired request.
 
          If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long
          period of time after ownership is obtained, the agent
          should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the
          ifTestStatus object back to 'notInUse'.  It is
          suggested that this time-out period be 5 minutes.
 
          In general, a management station must not retransmit a
          request to invoke a test for which it does not receive
          a response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's
          MIB to determine if the invocation was successful.
          Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the
          invocation request retransmitted.

          Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-
          line in order to execute them, or may even require the
          agent to reboot after completion of the test.  In these
          circumstances, communication with the management
          station invoking the test may be lost until after
          completion of the test.  An agent is not required to
          support such tests.  However, if such tests are
          supported, then the agent should make every effort to
          transmit a response to the request which invoked the
          test prior to losing communication.  When the agent is
          restored to normal service, the results of the test are
          properly made available in the appropriate objects.
          Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned
          to an interface must be unchanged even if the test
          causes a reboot.  An agent must reject any test for
          which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints,
          make available at least the minimum amount of
          information after that test completes.

        specific port and destined for a specific MAC
        address, are allowed to be forwarded.  Each octet
        within the value of this object specifies a set of
        eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports
        1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9
        through 16, etc.  Within each octet, the most
        significant bit represents the lowest numbered
        port, and the least significant bit represents the
        highest numbered port.  Thus, each port of the
        bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of
        '1' then that port is included in the set of

        value of '0'.  (Note that the setting of the bit
        corresponding to the port from which a frame is

            The length of this object is always 180 octets. One octet represents
            one CPU load value of one measurement. One measurement generates one
            sample value. The measure time of a sample is a second. The maximum
            measure time is 180 seconds. So the maximum number of samples is 180.
            The interval time between start and stop (or show) operation may be
            less 180 seconds. So the sample number may be less than 180. The left
            octet will be padded with H'FF if the sample number is less than 180
            and keeps the octet length always 180.
            The type of cpuLoadDetail variable is OCTET STRING. Each octet can
            be intepreted as a double-digit (binary ecoded value) integer.
            The cpuLoadDetail indicates 180 double-digit (binary value) integers.
            Each integer indicates the CPU load percent value of a measurement.
            The order of measurement value is:
            In case of the measurement time is >= 180 seconds, only the last 180
            samples are keeped; the 1st octet is the 1st measurement value of the
            last 180 sample; the 2nd octet is the 2nd measurement value of the
            last 180 sample; the 180th octet is the 180th measurement value of
            the last 180 sample. A wrap around buffer will be used to store the
            measurement values.
            In case of the measurement time is < 180 seconds, the samples are
            less than 180, the 1st octet is the measurement value of 1st sample;
            the 2nd octet is the measurement value of 2nd sample; the left

             For a RFC2131 relay agent (full relay agent), this object
             should be configured to doNotChange(1).
             The typical case in which this object may be configured to 
             copySourceMacAddr(2), is the following:
               - the relay agent is in the context of a bridge, and as such
                 this relay agent is doing simplified relay, this means no
                 transformation of broadcast message into a set of unicast 
                 messages;
                 and
               - there is an upstream full relay agent;
                 and
               - the bridge is an IP-aware Bridge that is doing MAC address
                 concentration, this means source MAC address is replaced by
                 the bridge's MAC address, so CHADDR and source MAc address
                 become different;
                 and;
               - the upstream relay agent uses CHADDR to route replies back
                 to the user.
             There might be a network inconsistency when the upstream full
             relay agent requires that CHADDR matches the MAC address of the
             bridge, while the DHCP server uses CHADDR to identify individual
             users.

             disabled for a particular VLan port the corresponding
             table entries are dynamically deleted by the manager.

                * Row Creation. An entry is created by a set-request with the
                  extDhcpRelayPortStatsRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). The 
                  set-request would be successful if:
                    - the VLan port, if specified as an index, has already been
                      created on the User side and has been associated with a
                      L2 forwarder. The L2 Forwarder cannot be of type S-VLan XC,
                      QoS Aware VLan XC and IPoA XC. For these L2 forwarding
                      modes DHCP Option 82 insertion is not supported and hence
                      no statistics can be enabled.
                    - the detailed counters have not already been enabled for
                      the specified VLan port.
                    - the total number of VLan ports for which
                      detailed counters have already been enabled has not yet
                      reached the maximum limit. At a given time, only ten
                      interfaces per LT can be enabled for detailed counters
                      (Limit is set as five detailed counters for
                      static vlan ports and five detailed counters for dynamic
                      vlan ports).

                * Row Deletion. A table entry is deleted by a set-request with
                  the extDhcpRelayPortStatsRowStatus set to destroy(6). A table
                  entry can also be auto-deleted. The auto-deletion happens when
                  the associated
                  VLan port gets detached from the previously attached L2
                  forwarder.  

                * Index Usage. The entry is indexed by an external table index,
                  extDhcpRelayPortIndex (from extDhcpRelayPortStatsSumTable). "

            "An entry in the DHCPv6 relay port detailed statistics table. All
             entries in the table are dynamically created by the manager whenever
             detailed statistics need to be enabled for a particular VLan port.
             Conversely whenever detailed statistics are to be
             disabled for a particular VLan port, the corresponding
             table entries are dynamically deleted by the manager.

                * Row Creation. An entry is created by a set-request with the
                  extDhcpv6RelayPortStatsRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). The 
                  set-request would be successful if:
                    - the VLan port, if specified as an index, has already been
                      created on the User side and has been associated with a
                      L2 forwarder. The L2 Forwarder cannot be of type S-VLan XC,
                      QoS Aware VLan XC and IPoA XC. For these L2 forwarding
                      Modes, DHCPv6 relay is not supported and hence
                      no statistics can be enabled.
                    - the detailed counters have not already been enabled for
                      the specified VLan port.
                    - the total number of VLan ports for which
                      detailed counters have already been enabled has not yet
                      reached the maximum limit. At a given time, the 
                      detailed counters can be enabled for up to five static 
                      vlan ports per LT.

                * Row Deletion. A table entry is deleted by a set-request with
                  the extDhcpv6RelayPortStatsRowStatus set to destroy(6). A table
                  entry can also be auto-deleted. The auto-deletion happens when
                  the associated VLan port gets detached from the previously
                  attached L2 forwarder.  

                * Index Usage. The entry is indexed by an external table index,

    STATUS  mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
           "An entry in the VCL table.  This entry is
                      used to model a bi-directional VCL.
                      To create a VCL at an ATM interface,
                      either of the following procedures are used:

                      Negotiated VCL establishment

                    (1) The management application creates
                        a VCL entry in the atmVclTable
                        by setting atmVclRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
                        This may fail for the following reasons:
                        - The selected VPI/VCI values are unavailable,
                        - The selected VPI/VCI values are in use.
                        Otherwise, the agent creates a row and
                        reserves the VPI/VCI values on that port.

                    (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable,
                        thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent
                        ATM traffic parameters and the QoS Class
                        for receive and transmit directions of the VCL.

                   (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the
                        atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists,
                        the manager must create a new row(s)
                        in that table.

                   (2b) The manager characterizes the VCL's traffic
                        parameters through setting the
                        atmVclReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the
                        atmVclTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values
                        in the VCL table, which point to the rows
                        containing desired ATM traffic parameter values
                        in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
                        will check the availability of resources and
                        may refuse the request.

                    (3) The manager activates the VCL by setting the
                        the atmVclRowStatus to active(1).
                        If this set is successful, the agent has
                        reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
                        traffic parameter values and the QoS Class
                        for that VCL.
                    (4) If the VCL terminates a VCC in the ATM host
                        or switch, the manager turns on the
                        atmVclAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VCL
                        traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
                        atmVcCrossConnectTable  must be used
                        to cross-connect the VCL to another VCL(s)
                        in an ATM switch or network.

                     One-Shot VCL Establishment

                     A VCL may also be established in one step by a
                     set-request with all necessary VCL parameter
                     values and atmVclRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).
                     In contrast to the negotiated VCL establishment
                     which allows for detailed error checking
                     (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
                     particular resource acquisition failures),
                     the one-shot VCL establishment
                     performs the setup on one operation but
                     does not have the advantage of step-wise
                     error checking.

                     VCL Retirement

                     A VCL is released by setting atmVclRowStatus to
                     destroy(6), and the agent may release all
                     associated resources.            "

         Agent logs the overall outcome of the test, success/failure into
         the atmfM4VcResult of atmfM4VcTestTable).
         atmfM4VcTestTable is used in way similar to the ifTestTable in RFC2233.
         The logic of getting the info about completion of a particular test
         (for more details, refer to definition of ifTestTable in RFC2233) and
         retrieving the test result is kept centrally with atmfM4VcTestTable.
         This is achieved by making atmfM4VcTestCode 
         (which is a OBJECT-IDENTIFIER) of atmfM4VcTestTable to point to 
         an (virtual) entry in this table.
         When Manager comes to know about the test completion, it can retrieve
         the result by sending a get-request on atmfM4VcTestCode.
         For example; in order to retrieve the result of a test ran on a VPL,
         which corresponds to an ATM i/f with ifIndex=a,
         get-request(atmfM4VpTestCode.a.f.atmfM4VcTestObject) has to be sent.
         In response, Agent sends get-response(<OID of 
         AsamAtmVcLoopbackVplVpiResult>.f.g.h),
         where f, g, h, i are the values of atmVclVpi, atmVclVci

                to identify via this object. The implementor
                should identify the chip which is usually
                called the Medium Access Control chip.
                If no such chip is easily identifiable,
                the implementor should identify the chip
                which actually gathers the transmit

                indications. This would allow a

                duplex mode is controlled using

                The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's

                A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                its specification.

                A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                link type MAUs.  The state of
                rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                as though it were powered down or not connected.
                The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                state will remove power from the AUI.

                Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                second would.  The agent is not required to
                return the value reset (6).

                Setting this variable to the value
                operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI

                mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                reset, the value of this attribute will be
                unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                transmission during which no collision is
                detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                has been no collision during the transmission
                then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                this attribute will only change during
                non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                10BASE-FP MAUs.

                For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                match the states within the respective link
                integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                MAU which implements management of
                auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                indication to remote fault.

                The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                or no loopback.

                The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                invalid signal has been received from the other
                end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                zero in the link status bit (reference section
                22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
                Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
                offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and
                Auto-Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11)."

                A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this

                Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                second would.  The agent is not required to

                these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                transmission during which no collision is
                detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                has been no collision during the transmission
                then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                this attribute will only change during
                non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                10BASE-FP MAUs.

                For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                match the states within the respective link
                integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                MAU which implements management of
                auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                indication to remote fault.

                The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                or no loopback.

                The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                faults from a system running auto-negotiation.

                The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                invalid signal has been received from the other
                end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                zero in the link status bit (reference section
                22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and
                RF2 bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link
                Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation

                A value that uniquely identifies the set of

                The value is a sum which initially takes the

                value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which

    DESCRIPTION "This object identifies the default
                administrative baseband MAU type, to be used in
                conjunction with the operational MAU type
                denoted by ifMauType.

                The set of possible values for this object is
                the same as the set defined for the ifMauType
                object.

                This object represents the
                administratively-configured type of the MAU.  If
                auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not
                implemented for this MAU, the value of this
                object determines the operational type of the
                MAU.  In this case, a set to this object will
                force the MAU into the specified operating mode.

                If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value
                of this object denotes the type to which the MAU
                will automatically revert if/when
                auto-negotiation is later disabled.

                NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to
                provide for underlying hardware implementations
                which do not follow the exact behavior specified
                above.  In particular, when
                ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
                to disabled, the agent implementation MUST
                ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as
                reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to
                the value specified by this object, rather than
                continuing to operate at the value earlier
                determined by the auto-negotiation function.

    DESCRIPTION "********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED **********

                A value that uniquely identifies the set of
                capabilities of the local auto-negotiation
                entity.  The value is a sum which initially
                takes the value zero.  Then, for each capability
                of this interface, 2 raised to the power noted
                below is added to the sum. For example, an
                interface which has the capability to support
                only 100Base-TX half duplex would have a value
                of 32768 (2**15).  In contrast, an interface
                which supports both 100Base-TX half duplex and
                and 100Base-TX full duplex would have a value of
                98304 ((2**15) + (2**16)).

                The powers of 2 assigned to the capabilities are
                these:

                Power   Capability
                  0       other or unknown

    ACCESS read-write
    STATUS mandatory
    DESCRIPTION
        "The CDRInterimGenPeriod object allows the operator to configure
        the Interim_CDR generation period. The CDRInterimGenPeriod can be
        configured within the range [0...60] minutes in multiple of 5 minutes
        and defaults to 15 minutes. Only the value '0' and values >= 15
        (in multiples of 5 minutes) shall be considered.
        The value '0' has a special meaning in the sense that configuring
        a value '0' means that the Interim-CDR is generated upon the expiry
        of the quarter of an hour Period (period by which CDR files are
        generated on the system disk). This period is fixed and the generation
        of the Interim-CDRs is independent from the time the full-view or
        pre-view session has started.
        Configuring values from 15 up to 60 minutes means that the Interim_CDR
        period is started at the moment the Start_CDR is generated but
        considering the CDRGenRecognition period meaning that the first
        CDRInterimGenPeriod timer shall be started with a value equal to
        the configured CDRInterimGenPeriod - the CDRGenRecognition period.
        A subsequent CDRInterimGenPeriod is then started with the configured
        value. Consequently the interim-CDR period is started separately for
        each full-view / pre-view session.
        Values in between '0' and '15' minutes are not considered as these
        would cause too many Interim-CDR be genearted. With the current
        dimensioning for memory resources on the LT and NT board and the disk
        space on the system disk, the system is not able to handle such
        a potential huge amount of CDRs with success.

        been configured to generate Interim-CDRs.

         In addition, special index values are defined to identify temporary

         offset is contained in xdslLineSpectrumProfileIndexOffset. A temporary
         entry exists only during the profile modification, it is created at
         xdslLineSpectrumProfileModifyStatus = modifyStart and is deleted at
         modifyCancel or modifyComplete. It can only be accessed during the
         modification to retrieve the updated parameters values of a profile.
         The nominal entry contains the original profile settings and is not
         updated until the profile modification is completed and validated.
         The offset entries are read only, all write operations must be
         performed using the nominal index.
         The getnext can be used to retrieve the nominal spectrum profile
         entries and does not return the temporary profiles entries at the
         special offset index values.

         OCTET 0: defines the characteristics (type and scale) of the PSD

         01 = logarithmic frequency scale).
         OCTET 0- bit 2..3: defines the type of the PSD shape (00= PSD mask,
         01= PSD template).
         Octet 1..3: defines PSD point #1
         OCTETS 1..2: INTEGER (0..30000), frequency of PSD point #1,
         expressed in kHz. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTET 3: INTEGER (0..255), -2*PSD level (in dBm/Hz) of

         mechanism to optimally apply the equal FEXT without providing any
         manual setting for this parameter.
         The value 1.8 dB results in a disabling of equal FEXT in the 
         respective upstream band.
         OCTETS (0,1) represent equal FEXT parameter of band 0, coded as an
         integer in the range 0, 18..630. The value is defined as 10 * the
         actual value in dB as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS (2*N,2*N+1) represent equal FEXT parameter of band N. 
         Maximum value for N is 4.
         This parameter is used when vdsl2RxPsdShapeUpstream is set to
         vdslEqualFextRxPsdUpstream and ignored otherwise.
         It is also ignored in US0 band and should be kept to 0 in that band.

        "This object provides the channel characteristics function real values
         in dB for each carrier group over the upstream passband.
         When the data are not available because the measurement is not
         completed, not enabled or not supported, an empty string will be
         returned.
         The XDSL upstream passband is composed of one or more bands (maximum
         5, including VDSL optional band).
         Hlog has a range of approximately +6 dB to -96 dB in steps of
         0.1 dB. The Hlog is represented as HLOGi = 6 - mi/10,
         with mi a 10 bits unsigned integer in the range 0 to 1022.
         The special value 1023 indicates that no measurement is available for
         the carrier or that the measurement is out of range.

         The carrier HLOGs are coded as a bitmap defined as follows:
         OCTETS 0,1: INTEGER, contains the number of symbols used to
         measure the data. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS 2,3: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the start carrier group of the
         first upstream band. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS 4,5: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the stop carrier group of the
         first upstream band. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS 6,7: INTEGER (0..1023), contains the HLOG mi of the first
         carrier group of the band (start carrier group).
         The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS 8..L: mi for the next carrier group and so on until the last
         carrier group of the first upstream band (stop carrier group).

         completed, not enabled or not supported, an empty string will be
         returned.
         The XDSL downstream passband is composed of one or more bands (maximum
         5, including VDSL optional band).
         HLIN has a range of approximately +6 dB to -90 dB, with a granularity
         of 2^-15. The Hlin is represented as
         HLINi = (scale/2^15)*((ai+j*bi)/2^15),
         with ai and bi 2 bytes signed integers in the range -32767 to 32767.
         The special value -32768 indicates that no measurement is available
         for the carrier or that the measurement is out of range.
         The scale factor is a 2 bytes unsigned integer. The scale factor
         must be chosen such that:
         max(|Ai|,|Bi|) over all i is equal to 2^15-1, i.e. over all carriers
         of the XDSL band(s) of the corresponding direction.

         The carrier HLINs are coded as a bitmap defined as follows:
         OCTETS 0,1: INTEGER, contains the number of symbols used to
         measure the data. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).

         OCTETS 4,5: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the start carrier group of the
         first downstream band. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).
         OCTETS 6,7: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the stop carrier group of the
         first downstream band. The value is defined as MSB-LSB (big-endian).

         The echo response is represented by a scale factor and an array of
         normalized complex numbers ai+j*bi, where i is the subcarrier index.
         It is represented as ECHOi = (scale/2^31)*((ai+j*bi)/2^31),
         with ai and bi 4 bytes signed integers in the range (-2^31+1) to
         (+2^31-1). The special value -2^31 (and for historical reason the value 0) 
         indicates that no measurement is available for the carrier or that the 
         measurement is out of range.
         The scale factor is a 4 bytes unsigned integer. The scale factor
         must be chosen such that: max(|ai|,|bi|) over all i is equal to 2^31-1.

         The echo response is coded as a bitmap defined as follows:
         OCTETS 0,1,2,3: INTEGER(0..4294967295), contains the scale factor to apply
         to the echo response values.

         OCTETS 6,7: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the stop carrier of the band.

         OCTETS L+2, L+3: INTEGER (0..4096), index of the stop carrier

        "This object defines the carrier mask for the given direction
         which will overrule the xdslLineCarrierMaskUpstream of the
         xdslLineSpectrumProfile attached to this line.
         The upstream carrier mask pattern is a bitlist of 64 bits, each bit
         corresponding to one frequency carrier of the DMT modem system. 
         Carrier 0 is represented by the most significant bit of the map, 
         carrier 63 is represented by the least significant bit of the map.
         An upstream carrier is suppressed by setting its corresponding bit to
         1.
         Pilot tones may not be suppressed. If one of the masked carrier is 
         defined as a pilot tone in the applicable DSL standard, the modem will
         not initialize.
         The masking of carriers that are not used in the upstream direction
         or that are not used by the XDSL operational mode will be ignored.
         Carriers 0 to 63 are used for all ADSL/ADSL2 operational modes.
         The carrier mask is not used in VDSL mode and will be ignored.
         The value 'all ones' indicates that the original SpectrumProfile

         This object specifies the transmitter-referred noise level for

         A number of 2 to 32 Noise PSD points can be specified downstream.
         The successive PSD points must have increasing (>/=) frequencies.
         It is allowed that for two successive PSD points, different PSD
         levels are defined at a same frequency (brickwall).
         Noise PSD points are defined in the range -140dBm/Hz..-40 dBm/Hz.
         A special value (-167,5 dBm/Hz) states no virtual noise has to be
         Applied on this frequency.
         The Noise PSD Shape is coded as a variable length octet string 
         defined as follows:
           Octet 0: reserved 
           Octet 1..3: defines PSD point #1

        DESCRIPTION     
        "The primary purpose of this read-only table:  allow the SNMP 
         manager to read real-time diagnostic measurements (e.g. the 
         SFP's received optical power level) from the A2 bank of a 
         manager-specified SFP.  The A2 bank and content are defined in 
         the SFF-8472 standard (available at ftp.seagate.com).  

         The table is indexed to allow support for any SFP cage in 
         the system.  

         In a particular release, SFP diagnostics support for a 
         particular assembly may or may not be provided, and support for 
         all the cages on a supported assembly may or may not be 
         provided.  If an assembly has any supported SFP cages, a row will be 
         present in this table for each of its SFP cages.  

         A row is present whether or not the SFP cage contains an SFP,
         and whether or not the SFP supports diagnostics.  If the SFP 
         cage contains an SFP, some status information (e.g. LOS and 
         TxFault status) is available in the row.  An enumerated object 
         (sfpDiagAvailable) is used to indicate the condition/error 
         (or no error) encountered when attempting to read the 
         diagnostics information for the specified cage (e.g. cage 
         empty, or A2 checksum failed). 

         Details are documented with the individual objects.

         The following table size field is set to 'not applicable', 
         since it does not make sense for the SNMP manager to cache the 
         values in this table.  The values will be different each time 
         they are read from agent.

         Five types of values are supported.  In the following text,

              that ' dBm' is included in the string.

         2.  'No Power'.  This is a special case because an SFP reading 
             of 0.00 mW cannot be converted to dBm (since log10(0.00) is  
             undefined).

            subtrees which are included in or excluded from the
            filter profile.

            Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
            sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the
            most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
            string value (extended if necessary, see below)
            corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
            the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
            octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
            sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

            Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
            the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
            determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this
            family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
            exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
            i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

            Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
            is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for
            each sub-identifier of the value of
            snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either:

              the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or

              the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
              sub-identifier of the value of
              snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.

            there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
            corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,
            then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
            required length.

            Note that when the value of this object is the
            zero-length string, this extension rule results in
            a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),

                 To create a new user (i.e., to instantiate a new
                 conceptual row in this table), it is recommended to
                 follow this procedure:

                   1)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.

                           usmUserStatus=createAndWait)
                       You should use a template user to clone from
                       which has the proper auth/priv protocol defined.

                 If the new user is to use privacy:

                   3)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
                       privKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
                       to be used for the new user. Let us call this
                       pkcValue.
                   4)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   5)  SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                           usmUserPrivKeyChange=pkcValue
                           usmUserPublic=randomValue1)
                   6)  GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue1.
                       If not, repeat steps 4-6.

                 If the new user will never use privacy:

                   7)  SET(usmUserPrivProtocol=usmNoPrivProtocol)

                 If the new user is to use authentication:

                   8)  generate the keyChange value based on the secret
                       authKey of the clone-from user and the secret key
                       to be used for the new user. Let us call this
                       akcValue.
                   9)  GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   10) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                           usmUserAuthKeyChange=akcValue
                           usmUserPublic=randomValue2)
                   11) GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue2.
                       If not, repeat steps 9-11.

                 If the new user will never use authentication:

                   12) SET(usmUserAuthProtocol=usmNoAuthProtocol)

                 Finally, activate the new user:

                   13) SET(usmUserStatus=active)

                 The new user should now be available and ready to be
                 used for SNMPv3 communication. Note however that access
                 to MIB data must be provided via configuration of the
                 SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB.

                 The use of usmUserSpinlock is to avoid conflicts with
                 another SNMP command generator application which may
                 also be acting on the usmUserTable."

                 When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual

                   - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol)
                   - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol)
                 They will be copied regardless of what the mandatory
                 value is.

                 Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret
                 authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption

                 key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same

                 user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as
                 required during user creation.

                 The first time an instance of this object is set by
                 a management operation (either at or after its

                 Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no

                 An instance of this object is created conmandatoryly

                 The associated protocol is the usmUserAuthProtocol.
                 The associated secret key is the user's secret

                 algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's

                 The recommended way to do a key change is as follows:

                   1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                   2) generate the keyChange value based on the old
                      (existing) secret key and the new secret key,
                      let us call this kcValue.

                 If you do the key change on behalf of another user:

                   3) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
                          usmUserAuthKeyChange=kcValue
                          usmUserPublic=randomValue)

                 If you do the key change for yourself:

                   4) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,

                 If you get a response with error-status of noError,
                 then the SET succeeded and the new key is active.
                 If you do not get a response, then you can issue a
                 GET(usmUserPublic) and check if the value is equal
                 to the randomValue you did send in the SET. If so, then
                 the key change succeeded and the new key is active
                 (probably the response got lost). If not, then the SET
                 request probably never reached the target and so you

                 usmUserEngineID, to be modified via a one-way
                 function.

                 The associated protocol is the usmUserPrivProtocol.
                 The associated secret key is the user's secret
                 privacy key (privKey). The associated hash
                 algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's
                 usmUserAuthProtocol.

                 When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName'

                 is usmNoPrivProtocol, then a set is successful, but
                 effectively is a no-op.

                 The idea here is that access to this column can be

                 This table provides information to SNMP Command

                 configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to
                 all contexts at the SNMP entity.

                 This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity
                 allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically
                 (for instance when its configuration changes).  Such
                 changes would happen only if the management
                 instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more
                 (or fewer) contexts.

                 The presence of entries in this table and of entries
                 in the vacmAccessTable are independent.  That is, a
                 context identified by an entry in this table is not
                 necessarily referenced by any entries in the
                 vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an
                 entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily
                 currently exist and thus need not be identified by an
                 entry in this table.

                 This table must be made accessible via the default
                 context so that Command Responder applications have

                 Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
                 a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
                 whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
                 needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
                 entry must be used for access control checking.

                 To select the proper entry, follow these steps:

                 1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
                    intersection of the following sets of entries:

                      the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName

                       - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
                         value of 'prefix' and matching
                         vacmAccessContextPrefix
                      intersected with the union of these two sets:
                       - the set of entries with identical
                         vacmSecurityModel
                       - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel
                         value of 'any'
                      intersected with the set of entries with
                      vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
                      to the requested securityLevel

                 2) if this set has only one member, we're done
                    otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
                    the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
                    SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
                    a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
                       matching the securityModel in the message is
                       not empty, then discard the rest.
                    b) if the subset of entries with
                       vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
                       in the message is not empty,
                       then discard the rest
                    c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
                       than the longest one remaining in the set
                    d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel

                 Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all
                 groups are really equivalent since the assumption that
                 the securityName has been authenticated does not hold. "

                 When creating a new view or altering an existing

                 interactions with other uses of the view.  The

                 the named view may be created (Set), including the

                 If another SNMP Command Generator application has

                 the spin lock.

                 Since this is an advisory lock, the use of this lock
                 is not enforced. "

vacmViewTreeFamilyTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX       SEQUENCE OF VacmViewTreeFamilyEntry
    ACCESS       not-accessible
    STATUS       mandatory
    DESCRIPTION "Locally held information about families of subtrees
                 within MIB views.

                 Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
                   - the included view subtrees, and
                   - the excluded view subtrees.
                 Every such view subtree, both the included and the

                 excluded ones, is defined in this table.

                 To determine if a particular object instance is in
                 a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
                 entries in this table.  If none match, then the
                 object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
                 more match, then the object instance is included in,
                 or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
                 sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
                 the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
                 is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
                 then the lexicographically greatest instance of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
                 exclusion.

                 An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
                 active entry in this table when the number of
                 sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
                 and each sub-identifier in the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
                 sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
                 either if the corresponding bit of the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
                 'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

                 A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
                 by a particular combination of values of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.

                 In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
                 to a single subtree.

                 When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command
                 Generator application should utilize the
                 vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions.  See
                 DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.

                 When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that
                 first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
                 created and then the 'included' entries.

                 When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
                 first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are

                 deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.

                 If a create for an entry for instance-level access
                 control is received and the implementation does not
                 support instance-level granularity, then an
                 inconsistentName error must be returned."

                 corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                 defines a family of view subtrees.

                 Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a
                 sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the
                 most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
                 string value (extended if necessary, see below)
                 corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
                 the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
                 octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
                 sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.

                 Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                 the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
                 determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
                 family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
                 exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
                 i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.

                 Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
                 is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for
                 each sub-identifier of the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either:

                   the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or

                   the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
                   sub-identifier of the value of
                   vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                 If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and

                 there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                 corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                 then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
                 required length.

                 Note that when the value of this object is the
                 zero-length string, this extension rule results in
                 a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
                 and the family of view subtrees is the one view
                 subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
                 instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                 Note that masks of length greater than zero length
                 do not need to be supported.  In this case this

         (ie: re-initialization of the agent would lose any changes).
         Also, no fault/performance monitoring is available in this state.

         persistently, the manager shall set this object to 'active'.

         the agent, the set will be denied.

         To remove an interface (unprovision), the manager shall set this
         object to 'notInService'.  Doing this also resets all configuration
         parameters associated with this entry to their default values.

To create a new conceptual row (or instance) of the

performed before the row can transition to 'Active' state:

          imaGroupTxFrameLength
          imaGroupMinNumTxLinks and
          imaGroupMinNumRxLinks 

        	To change (modify) an imaGroupTable entry, the imaGroupRowStatus 
object must be set to 'notInService'. Only then can the
conceptual row be changed. 

        	To remove (delete) an imaGroupTable entry from this table, set
        	imaGroupRowStatus to 'destroy.'

        	Setting the imaGroupRowStatus to 'Active' has the effect of
activating the Group Startup Procedure.  The Group Startup Procedure
        	uses provisioned links that have imaLinkRowStatus set to
'Active' an imaLinkGroupIndex set the imaGroupIndex in this conceptual row.

        	When the imaGroupRowStatus is not in 'Active' state, the Group State
        	machine is in its 'Not Configured' state.

        	ALCATEL NOTE: In ASAM, entries are automatically created

        un-provisioned by setting the 'imaGroupRowStatus' to 'notInService'.
        Configuration changes made to an un-provisioned entry are not saved
        persistently (ie: restart will reset data to default values) until the 
        row is 'activated'.  Un-provisioning an 'active' entry will also reset

        A successful set of the object imaLinkGroupIndex must be 
        performed before the RowStatus of this new row can transition

        To change (modify) an imaLinkTable entry, the imaLinkRowStatus 
        object must be set to 'notInService'. Only then can the
        conceptual row be changed. Setting object imaLinkGroupIndex to

                not contain 'Alcatel' in the Vendor Specific 
                Data field.

                Bit 2 is set when the SFP is in Automatic Laser

                is not seen anymore.

                If bit 0 is set, setting of the other status bits makes
                no sence, e.g. the ASAM cannot check the label of an SFP

          'underneath' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer
          corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
          example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs
          underneath the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this
          table contains:

            ifInvStackStatus.x.y=active

          For each ifIndex value, z, which identifies an active
          interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
          in this table associated with z.  For one of these rows, z
          is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, z is the
          value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If z is not involved in
          multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
          with z.)

          For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has
          no others stacked on top or below it:

            ifInvStackStatus.z.0=active
            ifInvStackStatus.0.z=active

          sublayer.  
                     
          This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
          interface via the dot3OamAdminState.  
   
          If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
          with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also,
          if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not 
          up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object 
          ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
          administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
          testing(3)).  
                           
          The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
          passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
          OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
          capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
          devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
          trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
          not yet made that determination.  
                           
          The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
          entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
          rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
          for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
          unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
          rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
          oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
          by the local device, the state moves to
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
          fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
          diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
          whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
          or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
          decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
          in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
          30.3.6.1.10).  
   
          If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
          becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
          sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
          states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
          difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
          the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
          via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
          aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  
                           
          When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
          OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
          operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
          Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].  
   
          Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
          completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
          nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
          enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)) but the interface is
          in half-duplex operation.

        DESCRIPTION 
          "This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this
          Ethernet like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in
          'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
          that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
          monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
          passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM
          actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
          the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM
          entity cannot.  
   
          The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
          system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The
          default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that
          this system should take on a subservient role to the other
          device connected over this interface.  
   
          Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration
          revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and
          potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the
          dot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

        DESCRIPTION 
          "The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet like interface.
          OAM consists of separate functional sets beyond the basic
          discovery process which is always required.  These functional
          groups can be supported independently by any implementation.
          These values are communicated to the peer via the local
          configuration field of Information OAMPDUs.  
   
          Setting 'unidirectionalSupport(0)' indicates that the OAM
          entity supports the transmission of OAMPDUs on links that are
          operating in undirectional mode (traffic flowing in one

          direction only).  Setting 'loopbackSupport(1)' indicates the
          OAM entity can initiate and respond to loopback commands.
          Setting 'eventSupport(2)' indicates the OAM entity can send
          and receive Event Notification OAMPDUs. Setting
          'variableSupport(3)' indicates the OAM entity can send and
          receive Variable Request and Response OAMPDUs.

        DESCRIPTION 
          "The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet like interface.
          OAM consists of separate functionality sets above the basic
          discovery process.  This value indicates the capabilities of
          the peer OAM entity with respect to these functions.  This
          value is initialized so all bits are clear. 
   
          If unidirectionalSupport(0) is set, then the peer OAM entity
          supports sending OAM frames on Ethernet interfaces when the
          receive path is known to be inoperable.   If
          loopbackSupport(1) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send
          and receive OAM loopback commands.  If eventSupport(2) is set,
          then the peer OAM entity can send and receive event OAMPDUs to
          signal various error conditions. If variableSupport(3) is set,
          then the peer OAM entity can send and receive variable
          requests to monitor attribute value as described in Clause 57
          of [802.3ah].   
   
          The capabilities of the OAM peer can be determined from the
          configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the most
          recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information
          TLV.  All zeros are returned if no Local Information TLV has
          yet been received.

        	Bit 0(LSB):when this bit is set to (value 1), it indicates   
		unidirectionalSupport

		Bit 1 : when this bit is set to (value 2), it indicates

                * Row Deletion. A table entry is deleted by a set-request with

DESCRIPTION
"An entry in the l2UserIpTable. All entries in the table are dynamically created.
                
* Row Creation. An entry is created by a set-request with the
                  l2UserIpRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). The set-request
                  would be successful if:
                    - the specified vlan port(user)interface exists.
                    - the specified vlan port is associated with a L2 forwarder.
   - the L2 forwarder should not be of type S-VLAN XCON,  Qos Aware VLAN or IPoA CC VLAN.
- the specified user IP address and prefix length does not 
                      overlap with the existing entries.
                    - the number of static users/subnet does not exceed 384 per LT.
   - the number of static users does not exceed 16k per LT after    decomposition
                    - the prefix length is not less than 23.

                * Row Deletion. A table entry is deleted by a set-request with
                  the l2UserIpRowStatus set to destroy(4). A table entry can
                  also be auto-deleted. The auto-deletion can happen when,
- the association between Vlan-port and L2 forwarder is removed (OR)
- the associated user interface gets deleted (OR)
- the associated L2 forwarder is deleted.

                * Index Usage. The ifIndex refers to the vlan-port (user) interface

         represents an MA.  An MA is a set of MEPs, each configured
         with a single service instance.
         
         Creation of a Service Instance establishes a connectionless
         association among the selected DSAPs.  Configuring a
         Maintenance association End Point (MEP) at each of the
         DSAPs creates a Maintenance Association (MA) to monitor
         that connectionless connectivity.  The MA is identified by a
         Short MA Name that is unique within the Maintenance Domain
         and chosen to facilitate easy identification of the Service
         Instance.  Together, the Maintenance Domain Name and the
         Short MA Name form the Maintenance Association Identifier
         (MAID) that is carried in CFM Messages to identify
         incorrect connectivity among Service Instances.  A small
         integer, the Maintenance association End Point Identifier
         (MEPID), identifies each MEP among those configured on a
         single MA (802.1ag clauses 3.17 and 18.2).

    DESCRIPTION 
        "The Maintenance Association End Point (MEP) table.
         
         Each row in the table represents a different MEP.  A MEP is
         an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific
         DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive
         CFM PDUs and track any responses.  It is an end point of a
         single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a
         separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in
         the same Maintenance Association (802.1ag clause 3.18).
         
         This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the
         indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason
         being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance
         Domain.
         
         The Transmit Loopback table.  Entries in this table are
         created/removed at the same time than entries in the MEP
         table are created/removed.
         
         The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending
         LBM and LTM.
         
         *LBM Managed objects
         
         LBM Managed objects in the MEP table 
         enables the management entity to initiate
         transmission of Loopback messages.  It will signal the MEP
         that it should transmit some number of Loopback messages
         and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the
         corresponding Loopback messages.
         
         Steps to use entries in this table:
         
         1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be
            'ready'.  To do this do this sequence:
            a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and
               dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP
               PDU).
            b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is
               'ready'
               - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above.
               - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go
                 to step 2) below
         2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from 'ready' to
            'notReady' to ensure no other management entity will use
            the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS
            do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo 
            and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP
            PDU,  and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind).
            For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you
            obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating
            NMSes will not step on each others toes.
         3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages,
            optional TLVs,...).
         4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn,
            dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu.
         6) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from 'notReady'
            to 'transmit' to initiate transmission of Loopback
            messages.
         7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to
            find out if the operation was successfully initiated or
            not.
         8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages.
            When it reaches 0, the last LBM has been transmitted.
            Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have
            been returned.
         9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder,
            and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step
            4, above, to get the results of the test.
         10) Change the dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value back to
            'ready' to allow other management entities to use the
            table.
         
         *LTM Managed objects
         The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner
         similar to that described for LBM transmission, above.  Upon
         successfully initiating the transmission, the variables
         dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and
         dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information
         required to recover the results of the LTM from the
         dot1agCfmLtrTable.
